            <h3>How long does it take to complete an IQ test?</h3>
            <p>

                <a href="/en/full-tests.html">extended IQ tests</a> are available for 15-60 minutes, which contain 40-80+ questions.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are the results of a quick IQ test accurate?</h3>
            <p>
                A quick IQ test provides an approximate assessment with a wide range (for example, "approximately 120, but between 100 and 160"). 
                For a more accurate IQ determination, it is recommended to take full tests with a large number of questions, 
                such as WAIS or Stanford-Binet.

            <h3>Are there IQ tests for children?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, we offer special IQ tests for children aged 6-16. They are age-adapted, have a game format

            <p>
                Although the basic level of intelligence is largely determined by genetics, regular brain training, learning new skills, 
                reading and solving logical problems can help improve cognitive abilities and IQ test results.

            <h3>What is the average IQ?</h3>
            <p>
                The average IQ is 100 points. Most people (about 68%) have an IQ in the range of 85 to 115 points. 
                An IQ above 130 is considered very high (about 2% of the population), and below 70 is considered very low (about 2% of the population).

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does an IQ test measure?</h3>
            <p>
                IQ tests assess various cognitive abilities: logical thinking, working memory, information processing speed, 
                verbal comprehension, spatial thinking and mathematical abilities. However, they do not measure creative abilities, 
                emotional intelligence or social skills.

        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I take the test multiple times?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you can take our quick IQ test as many times as you want. However, keep in mind that when retaking, 
                you may remember the answers, which may affect the accuracy of the result. For a more objective assessment, 
                it is recommended to take the test with an interval of several weeks.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the difference between a quick and extended IQ test?</h3>
            <p>
                A quick IQ test consists of 7 questions and takes 2-3 minutes. It provides an approximate assessment with a wide range. 
                Extended IQ tests contain 40-80+ questions, take 15-60 minutes and provide a more accurate IQ assessment. 
                They also assess various aspects of intelligence in more detail.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this test official?</h3>
            <p>
                No, our quick IQ test is not an official professional test (such as WAIS, Stanford-Binet or Raven). 
                This is a simplified online test to get an approximate assessment. For an official IQ assessment, it is recommended 
                to consult a professional psychologist.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How to interpret IQ test results?</h3>
            <p>
                The results show an approximate range of your IQ. For example, if the result is "approximately 120, but between 100 and 160", 
                this means that your IQ is likely in this range. Remember that quick tests only provide an approximate assessment, 
                and professional tests are needed for accurate IQ determination.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I share test results?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you can share test results on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram) or copy the link. 
                This will help your friends also take the test and compare results.
